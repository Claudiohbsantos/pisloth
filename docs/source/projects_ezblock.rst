Projects
=========================

Here, we show you the projects of playing PiCar-X on Ezblock Studio. If you are new to these, 
you can try to write the corresponding function according to TIPS, or directly 
use the reference code in Example. We suggest you do it yourself and experience the 
fun of challenges.

If you don't want to write these projects one by one, we have uploaded them to Ezblock Studio's Examples page and you can run them directly or edit them and run them later.

Also on the Examples page you can choose Block or Python language, but in the projects below, only the Block language is explained.

You can use this `file <XXX>`_ to help you understand the Python code.
